Newsletter Harvesting Project

This project involves the harvesting of newsletters sent to the Middlesex-London Food Policy Council.  

Members are given directions to forward emails to a particular address.  
The script reads the email, processes the information, and sends the
information as a GET request to a private page.

This page uses the mlfpc_newsletter_plugin to add the information to the database.
